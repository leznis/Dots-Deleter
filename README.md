# Dots-Deleter
This simple file removes every dot (to be customizable soon) from every other files' name in a specified folder.
y first own projects (with some help from StackOverflow, coz I didn't know "os" yet). Can be used to delete dots from movie names like "Minecraft.Movie.2024.1080p.etc.nbc", and was originally designed to to just that, many times, on many files. Any report of issue, or advice how to make my code more clear would be VERY appreciated. Thank you :)
